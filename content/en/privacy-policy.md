- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data gets automatically scooped up when you use the Service. 📊

This Usage Data might include your device's Internet Protocol address (like your IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages you check out on our Service, the time and date of your visit, how long you hung out on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

When you're hitting up the Service via a mobile device, we might automatically gather certain info. This includes, but isn't limited to, the type of mobile device you're rocking, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

Also, your browser sends us info that we might collect when you visit our Service, or when you access it through a mobile device.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We use Cookies and other similar tracking technologies to keep an eye on activity on our Service and store certain bits of info. 🕵️‍♀️ The tracking tech we use includes beacons, tags, and scripts, all designed to gather and track info, and generally improve and analyze our Service. Here's a peek at what we might use:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a small file plopped onto your device. You can tell your browser to say "no thanks" to all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But heads up, if you don't accept Cookies, you might not be able to use some cool parts of our Service. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to reject Cookies, our Service might just use them. 🍪
- **Web Beacons**: Some sections of our Service and our emails might have tiny electronic files called web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These little guys let the Company, for example, count users who've visited those pages or opened an email, and for other related website stats (like checking out how popular a certain section is and making sure systems and servers are all good).

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies hang around on your personal computer or mobile device even when you go offline, while Session Cookies vanish as soon as you close your web browser. Poof! 💨

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for the purposes listed below:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely crucial for hooking you up with services available through the Website and letting you use some of its cool features. They help verify user identities and prevent shady use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for simply can't be delivered, and we only use 'em to give you those specific services. 🛠️

- **Cookies Policy / Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are all about figuring out if users have given the green light to using Cookies on the Website. 👍

The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience and save you from having to punch in your preferences every single time you use the Website. 🧠

### How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes we've laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data to the extent needed to stick to our legal obligations (like if we gotta hold onto your data to follow applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. ⏰

The Company also keeps Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is usually kept for a shorter period, unless it's used to beef up the security of our Service or boost its functionality, or if we're legally obligated to hang onto it for a longer stretch. 🔒

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your information (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and anywhere else the parties involved in the processing are located. This basically means your info could be shipped off and stored on computers outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where data protection laws might be different from yours. 🌍

By giving this Privacy Policy a nod and submitting such info, you're signing off on that transfer. ✅

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and plays nice with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information. 👍

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've totally got the right to delete your Personal Data, or to ask us to help you delete the Personal Data we've collected about you. 🗑️

Our Service might let you zap certain info about yourself right from within the Service itself.

You can always log into your account (if you've got one!) and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info to update, modify, or ditch your info. You can also give us a shout to request access to, correct, or scrub any personal info you've given us.

But keep in mind, we might need to hang onto certain info when we have a legal obligation or a legitimate reason to do so. Just sayin'.

### Disclosing Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets into a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is moved over and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy. 🚨

#### Law Enforcement
Under certain circumstances, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if it's required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or government agency). 👮‍♀️

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might spill your Personal Data if it genuinely believes such action is necessary to: 👇
- Play by legal obligations
- Protect and defend the Company's rights or property
- Prevent or investigate possible screw-ups related to the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Service users or the public
- Guard against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep in mind that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% bulletproof. 😬 While we hustle to use commercially acceptable ways to shield your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. Bummer, we know.

## Kids' Privacy
Our Service isn't meant for anyone under 13. Nope, not at all! We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has given us Personal Data, please get in touch with us. If we find out we've scooped up Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to ditch that info from our servers. 🧒👧

If we need to lean on consent as a legal reason for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's permission before we collect and use that info. Just a heads up!

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that we don't operate. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously suggest you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. 🔗

We have zero control over the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services, and we don't take any responsibility for 'em. Just sayin'! 🚫

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we'll let you know about any changes by simply posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. Easy peasy! ✨

Before changes kick in, we'll ping you via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the 'Last updated date' at the very top of this Privacy Policy. 📧

We totally recommend you check out this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they're posted on this page. Stay in the loop! 🔄
