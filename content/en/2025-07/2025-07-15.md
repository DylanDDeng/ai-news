1.  **StreamDiT** is here, and it's a game-changer! Developed by top-notch research teams from **Meta** and **UC Berkeley**, this groundbreaking **AI model** can actually generate **real-time video streams frame-by-frame**. Seriously, with just a **single high-end GPU**, it can churn out smooth 512p videos at 16 frames per second. Its performance with dynamic videos is mind-blowing, way outperforming existing tech. So, how does StreamDiT pull off this magic trick? It's all thanks to its unique **custom architecture** and a **key acceleration technique** that slashes computational steps from 128 down to a mere **8 steps**. This major breakthrough hints at a huge future for **real-time interactive video content creation**. While it still has a few quirks with video memory, it's undeniably an exciting frontier breakthrough in **AI News**!
2.  Here's a cool surprise for our **AI News** feed, thanks to the latest research from Tsinghua University and Tencent Hunyuan X team! They've uncovered something wild: in **multimodal large models**, less than 5% of the attention heads (dubbed "visual heads") are actually doing the heavy lifting for **visual content understanding**. This astonishing discovery of **visual head sparsity** is like a compass pointing the way for model optimization! üß≠ Building on this, the research team introduced the **SparseMM** method. By smartly allocating cache resources, they not only kept performance top-notch but also boosted inference speed by an incredible **1.87 times** and slashed **peak memory usage** by **52%**. This totally opens up new possibilities for efficient deployment of **multimodal large models**. We're hyped for what this means for future **AI Daily** updates! Check out more deets at [Paper Address](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05344).
